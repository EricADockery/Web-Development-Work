				<p> 
					This page is to show my work to potential employers. I will be constantly adding more material to this site as it develops. The best way to show your ability to program is to show your programs to people. I hope you find what I have useful.

					I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Louisville studying computer engineering and computer science. I have completed two co-op terms at Advanced Micro Devices in Austin, Texas, mostly dealing with hardware/software testing in the PEO team of GPU. After my experience at AMD I feel that my intrest are leaning more towards software developement. I also greatly enjoy building webpages and the thought of becoming a front end developer seems very exciting. My artistic skill on the other hand is very limited and I do not believe that I would be a good webpage designer. Here is the most recent resume I have on file <a href="EricDockeryResume.doc"target="_blank">resume</a>.

					Below our videos of my Java programs running with the sorce code below it. Most of this work was completed in a classroom setting.

				<p>
					Although I have currently only taken the C programming course related to Electrical Engineering Students, below is what I have accomplished so far in my development of that language.

					<h1>
						Python
					</h1>
				</header>
				<p> 
					This is a required course at the University of Kentucky for both computer and electrical engineering majors. A lot of my programs for this class were lost due to a hard drive corruption and lack of backing up my data. (Boy did I learn my lesson on that.) Here is the work or re-work that I have completed in python.

			<section id="html">
				<header>
					<h1>
						HTML
					</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					All my HTML work was developed on my own time. I have built a few webpages, mostly for myself, but I also have built a page for my mothers beauty shop and published it on GoDaddy.com. Everything else besides this page of course was never hosted. It was all used to better develope my web programming.
